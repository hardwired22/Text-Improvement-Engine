The Text Improvement Engine project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used for development and implementation of functionality.
- Transformers (Hugging Face): A library for working with pretrained Transformer models, such as BERT.
- scikit-learn: A library for data analysis and machine learning, used for calculating text similarity.
- Pandas: A library for data manipulation, used for loading standardized phrases

Design

Integration with the Transformers library has been implemented to utilize the BERT model for text similarity analysis.
